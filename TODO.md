# TODO

1. **Add missing ON DELETE/ON UPDATE actions for the foreign keys**
    - Review the database schema to identify foreign keys without ON DELETE/ON UPDATE actions.
    - Define appropriate cascading actions to maintain referential integrity.

2. **Suggest indexes for better performance**
    - Analyze query patterns and identify columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
    - Propose indexes to optimize query performance.

3. **Attendance system for the schema**
    - Design and implement a schema to track attendance.
    - Include tables for users, attendance records, and any necessary relationships.
    - Ensure the schema supports efficient querying and reporting.
