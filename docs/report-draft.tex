\textbf{Database Setup and Schema Design}
To integrate a database into the system, the first step is to choose a lightweight and easy-to-configure solution—SQLite for local development, or PostgreSQL for production. Using an ORM like SQLAlchemy with Flask ensures smooth interactions with the database. The schema would include a table called \texttt{analysis\_results} to store information such as the project category (e.g., foundation, superstructure), similarity score, percentage of work completed, timestamps, and references to the uploaded images (previous and current). This schema ensures each analysis is logged and can be referenced later.

\textbf{Storing Results During Image Analysis}
Once the backend processes a pair of images and computes the progress using SSIM, the resulting data—such as similarity score and work completion percentage—can be saved to the database. Alongside these computed values, the filenames or paths of the images used are stored to maintain traceability. This insertion happens automatically within the \texttt{process\_images\_for\_category} function after the analysis step. Persisting these results allows for historical tracking, auditing, and report generation, ensuring that progress over time can be reviewed and compared reliably.

\textbf{Retrieving and Using Stored Data}
To access stored analysis records, a new API route like \texttt{/results} can be introduced. This endpoint fetches all past analyses, returning them in a structured JSON format to the frontend. These records can then be visualized on dashboards, filtered by category, date, or progress level. This persistent storage approach ensures that even if the system restarts or if users want to audit progress later, all relevant data remains available, creating a seamless bridge between AI analysis and project documentation.

\section{Database Schema for Users Table}
The \texttt{users} table is defined within the \texttt{ibcm} schema to manage user information. Below is a breakdown of its structure:


\section{Module Description}
To implement database integration in the construction progress monitoring system, the first step involves setting up the database configuration within the Flask application. This is typically done using SQLAlchemy, which provides an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) layer to interact with the database in a Pythonic way. The configuration includes defining the database URI—for example, using SQLite during development for simplicity or PostgreSQL for production environments—and initializing the SQLAlchemy instance with the Flask app. This step also involves setting any required options, such as turning off modification tracking to improve performance. Once configured, the application can automatically create the required tables upon initialization, ensuring that all necessary database structures are in place when the server starts.

Next, the schema design defines how analysis results will be stored in the database. A model class, such as \texttt{AnalysisResult}, is created using SQLAlchemy, where each class attribute represents a column in the corresponding table. This model might include fields such as a unique identifier, the type of construction activity (e.g., foundation, superstructure, interiors), the similarity score calculated by the image analysis algorithm, the estimated percentage of work completed, and a timestamp indicating when the analysis was performed. Additionally, the filenames or file paths of the uploaded images used in the comparison are stored to maintain traceability. These models not only allow for easy insertion and querying of data but also help maintain a clean and structured way of handling complex application data.

When a user uploads images for analysis, the backend logic responsible for handling the request processes the images and calculates the similarity score using the defined machine learning model. Once the analysis is complete, the relevant data—such as the project category, similarity score, work completion percentage, and image references—is packaged and inserted into the database using the model's interface. This automated recording of results ensures that each analysis session is stored persistently, providing a reliable history of construction progress over time. Committing these records to the database also means the system remains stateless across sessions, preserving data even if the application is restarted or deployed across multiple environments.

To support data retrieval, a new API endpoint can be added that fetches stored analysis results from the database. This endpoint, typically implemented using a GET route, queries the database for recent records, formats them into JSON, and sends them to the frontend. The API response may include all stored metadata, such as the type of work, progress percentage, and associated image file paths. This modular approach allows for easy integration with the frontend dashboards, where users can view previously analyzed results, track changes over time, and generate reports based on historical data. Such an endpoint provides a clean separation of concerns by keeping data access logic on the server side while enabling rich user experiences on the client side.

Finally, the frontend application can be extended to consume this data dynamically. Components such as dashboards, tables, or charts can be populated by fetching data from the new results API endpoint. This allows for real-time or near-real-time updates to the user interface, showing progress analysis from previously uploaded images. The visualizations can include timelines, charts comparing different project stages, or audit logs that allow users to revisit and inspect past activity. The integration of persistent storage ensures that the system transitions from a one-off analysis tool to a complete historical tracking platform, capable of supporting informed decision-making and detailed project documentation throughout the lifecycle of a construction project.

\section{Code Snippets (if needed)}

% Adding explanation for process_images_for_category function
\subsection{process\_images\_for\_category Function}
The \texttt{process\_images\_for\_category} function is a helper function designed to handle the processing of two image files (\texttt{previous\_image} and \texttt{current\_image}) uploaded via an HTTP POST request. Below is a breakdown of its functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input Validation:} The function first checks if both \texttt{previous\_image} and \texttt{current\_image} are present in the \texttt{request.files} object. If either of them is missing, it returns a JSON response with an error message (\textit{"Please provide both previous and current images"}) and an HTTP status code of 400 (Bad Request).
    \item \textbf{File Retrieval:} If both files are present, the function retrieves them from the \texttt{request.files} object and assigns them to the variables \texttt{previous\_image} and \texttt{current\_image}.
\end{itemize}

This function ensures that the required inputs are validated and properly retrieved before proceeding with further image analysis or processing.

    \label{fig:sample_image}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Schema Creation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Schema Creation:} The \texttt{ibcm} schema is created if it does not already exist, with the default character set \texttt{utf8mb4} and collation \texttt{utf8mb4\_0900\_ai\_ci}.
    \item \textbf{Primary Key:} The \texttt{id} column is an auto-incrementing integer that uniquely identifies each user.
    \item \textbf{User Details:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{name}: Stores the user's full name (up to 100 characters).
        \item \texttt{username}: A unique username for the user (up to 50 characters).
        \item \texttt{email}: A unique email address for the user (up to 100 characters).
        \item \texttt{password\_hash}: Stores the hashed password for authentication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This schema ensures efficient storage and retrieval of user data while maintaining data integrity through unique constraints on the \texttt{username} and \texttt{email} columns.

% --- Results and Discussion ---
% CHAPTER 6: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
\chapter{Results and Discussion}
This chapter presents the findings of the research and provides an interpretation of the results in the context of the research objectives and existing literature.

The integrated construction progress monitoring system successfully demonstrates its core functionality by processing image pairs, analyzing structural changes, storing results in a database, and rendering them on a dynamic frontend interface. Upon uploading images to any of the category-specific endpoints (foundation, superstructure, interiors), the system computes a similarity score using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), which quantifies visual differences between images. The output includes a similarity score and an estimated percentage of work completed. These values were consistently accurate during test cases involving sample images with distinct levels of structural change, validating the effectiveness of SSIM for visual comparison in construction contexts.

The system’s backend, powered by Flask and SQLAlchemy, effectively persists each analysis session in a relational database. Each record captures key information such as the project category, similarity score, progress percentage, and references to the image files used. Database queries confirmed that each API call correctly inserted a new record with precise data, demonstrating reliable and consistent write operations. The use of SQLAlchemy’s ORM further ensured data integrity and simplified integration without introducing raw SQL complexity.

From a frontend perspective, the dashboard successfully retrieved and displayed analysis results through the \texttt{/results} API. The dynamic rendering of this data using tables and charts confirmed the seamless communication between backend storage and the user interface. Users are able to view historical progress data, sort by category or timestamp, and visually interpret changes via linked result images. This end-to-end flow—from image upload to visualized analytics—establishes the system as not only a reactive image processing tool, but a fully integrated project management assistant.

The integration also highlighted some discussion points regarding scalability and user experience. While SQLite serves as a sufficient backend for local development and testing, transitioning to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL would be advisable for deployment in multi-user environments. Additionally, enriching the analysis model to detect specific elements (e.g., scaffolding, materials, or human activity) via object detection could enhance insights beyond percentage progress. Future iterations could also include automated scheduling, user authentication, or cloud storage for uploaded images.

Overall, the results validate the system’s capability to automate construction monitoring with measurable and storable outputs, while the discussion identifies opportunities for extending its accuracy, usability, and scalability in real-world deployments.

The significant reduction in analysis time compared to manual methods underscores the efficiency of the system. Furthermore, the scalability tests confirm that the system can handle real-world usage scenarios with multiple concurrent users.

The integration of a user-friendly dashboard and error-handling mechanisms enhances the overall user experience. The historical data tracking feature provides valuable insights into project trends, enabling better decision-making. The export functionality further adds to the system's utility by allowing users to generate reports for stakeholders.

However, certain limitations were observed:
